    <h1 class="special">Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you putsauce on first, before you make the base it does't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on the sauce it's messed up too</h4>

    <p class="special">Making a pizza is similar to coding. 
        There are certain things we have to do first. 
        like making a base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, 
        add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve.
        Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly.
        You can have everything you need to make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>
 
     <h5>This is how you make a pizza</h5>
     <p><small>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a pizza, 
         we will list them here.</small></p>

     <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza base</li>

        <li>add toppings</li>
        <li>add cheese</li>
        <li>bake</li>

    </ol>

    <h6>The toppings are different, they change for every occasion and taste. 
        There is no order to toppings. So we will list them like this.</h6>
